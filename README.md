## Logistic Regression 

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
In simple words, the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).   

### **Steps involved**   
1. Importing the libraries.
2. Importing the dataset.
3. Splitting the dataset to training and testing sets.
4. Feature Scaling.
5. Training the logistic regression model on training set.
6. Predicting a new result.
7. Predicting the test result.
8. Making the confusion matrix.
9. Visualizing the training set results.
10. Visualizing the testing set results.
